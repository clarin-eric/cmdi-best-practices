\subsection{Outline}\label{outline}

The first two sections of the CMDI Best Practice guide follow the
lifecycle of Component Metadata, i.e.~modelling CMD and authoring CMD
records. Best practices are given for various CMD constructs encountered
at the different levels. Both these sections also provide guidelines
regarding the workflow, e.g. (sequences of) actions to take and tools to
use, and indicators of potential problems (also known as `smells').

\emph{TODO: Some approaches and problems, which can be considered
``crosscutting concerns'', having aspects that are not limited to either
modelling or authoring, are covered in their own section.}
