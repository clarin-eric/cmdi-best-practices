## Outline {#outline}

The first two sections of the CMDI Best Practice guide follow the lifecycle of Component Metadata, i.e. modelling CMD and authoring CMD records. Best practices are given for various CMD constructs encountered at the different levels. Both these sections also provide guidelines regarding the workflow, e.g. \(sequences of\) actions to take and tools to use, and indicators of potential problems \(also known as ‘smells’\).
