## General XML {#general-xml}

###### X1: Include a reference to the profile XSD generated by the Component Registry

For each profile stored in the Component Registry a dynamically generated XSD is available. The URL of this XSD is available in the Info dialog of a profile and should be included in the schemaLocation attribute on the CMD root element. This enables validation of a CMD record by general XSD validators, including the CMDI Validator. The Component Registry URL should be used as it ensures that fixes in the transformation from a profile specification into an XSD are included in the validation process.

###### X2: Use common namespace prefixes

Namespace prefixes are officially just syntactic sugar in XML, i.e., provide a convenient shortcut. However, using common prefixes enable users to quickly assess the scope of an element. The CMDI 1.2 specification recommends the following prefixes for the namespaces URIs in CMDI:

| Prefix | Namespace Name | Comment | Recommended Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cmd | [http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/1](http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/1) | CMDI instance \(general/envelope\) | prefixed |
| cmdp | [http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/1/profiles/{profileId}](http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/1/profiles/{profileId}) | CMDI payload \(profile specific\) | prefixed |
| cue | [http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/cues/1](http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/cues/1) | Cues for tools | prefixed |
| xs | [http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema) | XML Schema | prefixed |
| xsi | [http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance) | XML Schema instance | prefixed |

###### X3: Use UTF-8 encoding

The encoding of a CMD record, i.e., XML documents in general, doesnâ€™t have to be stated explicitly. It can be provided in various, possibly conflicting ways: via a Byte Order Marker \(BOM\), in the XML declaration of the document or a HTTP header. The best practice is to align all these methods to express an UTF-8 encoding, but include at least the XML declaration to indicate the encoding used.
