X1: Include a reference to the profile XSD generated by the Component Registry

\priority{high}\clarinb{6.6}\checker{CMDI Instance Validator}

For each profile stored in the Component Registry a dynamically generated XSD is available. The URL of this XSD is available in the Info dialog of a profile and should be included in the schemaLocation attribute on the CMD root element. This enables validation of a CMD record by general XSD validators, including the CMDI Validator. The Component Registry URL should be used as it ensures that fixes in the
transformation from a profile specification into an XSD are included in the validation process.

X2: Use common namespace prefixes

\priority{low} \bptodo{TODO: check: CMDI Instance Validator}

Namespace prefixes are officially just syntactic sugar in XML, i.e., provide a convenient shortcut. However, using common prefixes enable users to quickly assess the scope of an element. The CMDI 1.2 specification recommends the following prefixes for the namespaces URIs in CMDI:

\note{Alex: this table might be too wide for the generated PDF; we need to look into it}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
     \textbf{Prefix} & \textbf{Namespace Name} & \textbf{Comment} & \textbf{Recommended Syntax} \\ \hline
     cmd & \tt{http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/1} & CMDI instance (general/envelope) & prefixed \\ \hline
     cmdp & \tt{http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/1/profiles/\{profileid\}} & CMDI payload (profile specific) & prefixed \\ \hline
     cue & \tt{http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/cues/1} & Cues for tools & prefixed \\ \hline
     xs & \tt{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema} & XML Schema & prefixed \\ \hline
     xsi & \tt{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-Instance} & XML Schema Instance & prefixed \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

See section \nameref{authoring-workflow} regarding validation, which implies well-formed XML.

X3: Use UTF-8 encoding

\priority{high}

\todo{Menzo: split: specify encoding used (high), use UTF-8 (high)}

The encoding of a CMD record, i.e., XML documents in general, doesn't have to be stated explicitly. It can be provided in various, possibly conflicting ways: via a Byte Order Marker (BOM), in the XML declaration of the document or a HTTP header. The best practice is to align all these methods to express an UTF-8 encoding, but include at least the XML declaration to indicate the encoding used.
