# CMDI Best Practices {#cmdi-best-practices}

Best practices for [Component Metadata](https://www.clarin.eu/cmdi) in [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu).

## TODOs

* [ ] Add icons or colours to indicate BP priority, maybe add an appendix with BP ordered by priority

* [ ] Also indications if a BP corresponds to a B Centre requirement, and also if/how its technically “validated” \(by the CMDI Validator or the Curation Module\)

* [ ] Add section numbers
