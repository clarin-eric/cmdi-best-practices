CMDI - Best Practices

CMDI and Curation taskforces

Add icons or colours to indicate BP priority, maybe add an appendix with BP ordered by priority

Also indications if a BP corresponds to a B Centre requirement, and also if/how its technically “validated” (by the CMDI Validator or the Curation Module)

Add section numbers
