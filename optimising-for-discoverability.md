## Optimising for discoverability

\[See [CR \#23](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cmdi-taskforce/cmdi-best-practices/changes/23)\]

An important advantage of publishing high quality metadata for resources is that it can vastly increase the discoverability of these resources. Metadata generally provides information that is not \(directly\) available from the digital object, service, tool or other resource itself, and therefore caters to a use case that is complementary to _content search_.

Most of the best practices described in this document serve the purpose, either implicitly or explicitly, to improve the discoverability of the described resources. Therefore in general it can be said that following the described best practices as closely as possible is the best way to optimise for discoverability. However in this section we will explicitly assume the discoverability perspective and focus on a number of salient aspects that either have the potential to strongly affect discoverability, are a common cause of suboptimal discoverability, or may not be obvious to the average metadata modeller or author.

To provide some context, we will first list, non-exhaustively, a number of possible types of scenarios that we consider cases of resource discovery:

* A user visits a **specific repository** where they may or may not expect to find access to a certain resource, or a resource with certain properties. If successful, the desired resource is provided to the user through the platform that was used to initiate the discovery.
* A users visits a metadata-driven catalogue, search engine or other **platform that aggregates metadata** from multiple sources such as the [VLO](https://www.clarin.eu/vlo), and browses or queries the indexed records on basis of a more or less specific set of criteria, eventually ending up at a place that provides \(a path to\) access to the actual resource, which may involve one or more intermediate steps including the 'native' repository that hosts the resource.
* A user performs a search using a **general purpose search engine** \(such as Google\) that crawls web pages and other online content, using salient keywords that match the metadata and/or content of the resource.
* A resource is **referenced** in a paper, in online content such as a website or blog post, or included in a collection that is consumed by a user, and hence discovered.

### Metadata formats and representation

One should keep in mind that the VLO and other metadata aggregators by design have a more or less **generic search interface and data model**, which means that in most cases they will not be as well suited for searching for resources in a specific context as search platforms tailored to that context. Repositories with a content-wise more limited scope \(or set of scopes\) can harness their 'knowledge' about the contained data to provide enhanced means of search, exploration and presentation. In fact, many repository solutions have a data schema \(encoded in their database or other data storage facility\) that is optimised for these purposes. In those cases, CMDI or Dublin Core metadata is often exported as a 'secondary' form of representation. In general this is a good solution, that allows for combining the benefits of specificity and generality. However it is important that the exported metadata is **fit for aggregation**, which implies a different context than that of the 'native' repository. Factors to keep in mind when designing the export from an internal representation to metadata for harvesting:

* \[sufficient context\]
* \[use of broadly accepted vocabularies\]
* ...

### Metadata completeness and VLO facets

Providing correct and complete metadata obviously improves discoverability. The more information you provide about your resources and their context, the higher the expected recall for queries that match your data. If you are looking for good representation and discoverability through the VLO, pay attention to its **facets**, which can be considered one of the main entry points into the data aggregated into the VLO. Ideally as many facets are covered as possible by _each metadata record_. Furthermore, a number of non-facet fields are displayed prominently in the search results, in particular a record's **title and description**, as well as licence and availability information. Records that are lacking this essential information not only are harder to find that those which do, but also are less likely to receive a high ranking, even if there is a match to a user's query.

Your repository may simply export its metadata to **Dublin Core ** \(it is one of the requirements of OAI-PMH\). However, notice that the set of attributes included in 'pure' Dublin Core does not necessarily allow for complete or semantically unambiguous metadata. If you are looking to tune your metadata to one ore more parts of the CLARIN infrastructure, it's worth investigating the option of exporting to a fitting CMDI profile, or to make your own dedicated profile. If this is not an option, you can also consider using the [OLAC extensions](http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/metadata.html) to enrich your Dublin Core metadata.

Finally, be aware of any context that your repository solution provides that is not directly encoded in the metadata of a single resource. The VLO, and the CLARIN infrastructure in general, will generally assume that a metadata record is self-sufficient. For example, if the name of your organisation is not included in a record, it will also not be associated with the described resources by the VLO. A metadata hierarchy might provide additional context, such as project information, collection details or legal status, but this will not cause this information to be presented in the context of the resource in a salient way unless it is explicitly included in its own metadata record.

### Values and semantics

\[Consider given vocabularies, e.g. resource type \(including links where to find these\)\]

\[Ensure conformity among records of on collection/institution \(e.g. naming conventions\)\]

\[Avoid ambiguities in modelling that can't be resolved technically \(e.g. &lt;date&gt; in very generally named branches\)\]

\[Avoid non-alphanumeric characters in titles \([Discussion \#19](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cmdi-taskforce/cmdi-best-practices/discussions/19)\)\]
