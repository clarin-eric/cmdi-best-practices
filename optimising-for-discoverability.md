## Optimising for discoverability

\[See [CR \#23](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cmdi-taskforce/cmdi-best-practices/changes/23)\]

An important if not the primary reason for creating metadata for resources and publishing it, as is common practice within CLARIN, is that it can vastly increase the discoverability of these resources. Metadata generally provides information that is not \(directly\) available in the digital object, service, tool or other resource and therefore caters to a use case that is complementary to _content search_.

Most of the best practices described in this document serve the purpose, either implicitly or explicitly, to improve the discoverability of the described resources. Therefore in general it can be said that following the described best practices as closely as possible is the best way to optimise for discoverability. However in this section we will explicitly take the discoverability perspective and focus on a number of salient aspects that either have the potential to strongly affect discoverability, are a common cause of suboptimal discoverability, or may not be obvious to the average metadata modeller or author.

To provide some context, we will first enumerate a number of possible types of scenarios that we consider cases of resource discovery:

* \['home' repository\]
* \[VLO\]
* \[google search\]
* \(references and citations in virtual collections, papers, web pages??\)

\[Metadata formats \('home' respository may have a more optimal representation\)\]

\[Attend to all facets \(search facets and display facets -- e.g. make sure a title of a resource is always provided\)\]

\[Consider given vocabularies, e.g. resource type \(including links where to find these\)\]

\[Ensure conformity among records of on collection/institution \(e.g. naming conventions\)\]

\[Avoid ambiguities in modelling that can't be resolved technically \(e.g. &lt;date&gt; in very generally named branches\)\]

\[Self-sufficiency of metadata records\]

\[Importance of landing page\]

\[Avoid non-alphanumeric characters in titles \([Discussion \#19](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cmdi-taskforce/cmdi-best-practices/discussions/19)\)\]
