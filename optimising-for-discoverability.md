## Optimising for discoverability

\[See [CR \#23](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cmdi-taskforce/cmdi-best-practices/changes/23)\]

An important if not the primary reason to create metadata for resources and publishing it, as is common practice within CLARIN, is that it can vastly increase the discoverability of these resources. Metadata generally provides information that is not \(directly\) available in the digital object, service, tool or other resource and therefore caters to a use case that is complementary to _content search_.



Attend to all facets \(search facets and display facets -- e.g. make sure a title of a resource is always provided\)

Consider given vocabularies, e.g. resource type \(including links where to find these\)

Ensure conformity among records of on collection/institution \(e.g. naming conventions\)

Avoid ambiguities in modelling that can't be resolved technically \(e.g. &lt;date&gt; in very generally named branches\)

Self-sufficiency of metadata records

Avoid non-alphanumeric characters in titles \([Discussion \#19](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cmdi-taskforce/cmdi-best-practices/discussions/19)\)
