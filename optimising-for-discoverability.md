## Optimising for discoverability

\[See [CR \#23](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cmdi-taskforce/cmdi-best-practices/changes/23)\]

An important if not the primary reason for creating metadata for resources and publishing it, as is common practice within CLARIN, is that it can vastly increase the discoverability of these resources. Metadata generally provides information that is not \(directly\) available in the digital object, service, tool or other resource and therefore caters to a use case that is complementary to _content search_.

Most of the best practices described in this document serve the purpose, either implicitly or explicitly, to improve the discoverability of the described resources. Therefore in general it can be said that following the described best practices as closely as possible is the best way to optimise for discoverability. However in this section we will explicitly take the discoverability perspective and focus on a number of salient aspects that either have the potential to strongly affect discoverability, are a common cause of suboptimal discoverability, or may not be obvious to the average metadata modeller or author.

To provide some context, we will first enumerate a number of possible types of scenarios that we consider cases of resource discovery:

* A user visits a **specific repository** where they may or may not expect to find access to a certain resource, or a resource with certain properties. If successful, the desired resource is provided to the user through the platform that was used to initiate the discovery.
* A users visits a metadata-driven catalogue, search engine or other **platform that aggregates metadata** from multiple sources such as the [VLO](https://www.clarin.eu/vlo), and browses or queries the indexed records on basis of a more or less specific set of criteria, eventually ending up at a place that provides \(a path to\) access to the actual resource, which may involve one or more intermediate steps including the 'native' repository that hosts the resource.
* A user performs a search using a **general purpose search engine** \(such as Google\) that crawls web pages and other online content, using salient keywords that match the metadata and/or content of the resource.
* A resource is **referenced** in a paper, in online content such as a website or blog post, or included in a collection that is consumed by a user, and hence discovered.

### Metadata formats and representation

\[Metadata formats \('home' respository may have a more optimal representation\)\]

### Metadata completeness and VLO facets

\[Attend to all facets \(search facets and display facets -- e.g. make sure a title of a resource is always provided\)\]

\[Self-sufficiency of metadata records\]

### Values and semantics

\[Consider given vocabularies, e.g. resource type \(including links where to find these\)\]

\[Ensure conformity among records of on collection/institution \(e.g. naming conventions\)\]

\[Avoid ambiguities in modelling that can't be resolved technically \(e.g. &lt;date&gt; in very generally named branches\)\]

\[Avoid non-alphanumeric characters in titles \([Discussion \#19](https://www.gitbook.com/book/cmdi-taskforce/cmdi-best-practices/discussions/19)\)\]
